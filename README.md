# Report Cards 2.0

> **Note:** This project was completed as part of my coursework for **Introduction to Object Oriented Programming** at **Canadore College** in **2021**.
> It may not reflect my current coding practices or skill level.

## Task
You are welcome to create a creative project of your choice. One suggestion is a video game or a business application.
For video games donâ€™t feel the need to do any graphics. It could be a role-playing game with random elements for interactive gameplay. Classes to create characters or objects that are generated. Other suggestions could be a trivia game, tic tac toe, snakes and ladders.
If you are interested in doing graphics, you are welcome to explore how on your own time. However, this is not required and likely will be quite time consuming so it is not recommended.
Rather, it is suggested to do a text-based game of some sort.
If you do a video game you likely will want to use random numbers. I can help if you need this, but first please look at Appendix E in the textbook, page 755. Your project must include the following to demonstrate your understanding of the course material:
- Use classes/objects
- Use polymorphic objects
- Use stream objects for input and output
- Use exception handling
- Use functions to solve problems
- Use conditional statements, loops
- Strings, and other variables.
- Demonstrate good use of Object-Oriented design including polymorphism, encapsulation, abstraction, and inheritance
- Thorough documentation in comments
In addition to your code file with the above include the following:
- A brief overview and explanation of the project: what it does and why you decided to do it in the way you did to keep with the 4 principles of object-oriented programming: encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.
